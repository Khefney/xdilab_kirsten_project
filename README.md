# xdilab_kirsten_project

Personal hub for my project work, experiments, and progress logs.  
It’s just me here—this repo keeps everything organized as I build, learn, and iterate.

---

## Goals
- Centralize projects, notes, and artifacts.
- Track daily/weekly progress with lightweight logs.
- Keep each project self-contained with a clear README and reproducible steps.
